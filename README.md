## 💡 Why These Exist

> As I built my pentest lab, I realized many tools are easy to *run* — but hard to *understand*.  
>  
> These tutorials bridge that gap:  
> - ✅ Each step is tested in my local environment  
> - ✅ I explain *why* I chose a flag or payload  
> - ✅ Mistakes and fixes are included (e.g., “Why sqlmap failed until I added `--level=3`”)  

Perfect for learners — and for me, a way to sharpen my communication.
